## AI vs Human Text Detector

A Machine Learning–based web application that classifies whether a given text is AI-generated or Human-written using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The app is deployed live using Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Project Overview

With the rise of generative AI tools, identifying whether text is written by humans or generated by AI has become increasingly important.  
This project builds a machine learning-based classifier that analyzes textual patterns and predicts the origin of the text with a confidence score.

- Text preprocessing using NLTK
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Classification using Logistic Regression
- Model confidence score using probability estimates
- Interactive Streamlit Web App
- Detects AI vs Human written text
- Simple and interactive web UI
- Real-time prediction
- Deployed online for public access
- End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → deployment)

## How It Works

1. Input text is cleaned (lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization)
2. Cleaned text is transformed using TF-IDF Vectorizer
3. Logistic Regression model predicts:
   - AI Generated
   - Human Written
4. Confidence score is calculated using prediction probabilities
5. Result is displayed in a Streamlit web interface
