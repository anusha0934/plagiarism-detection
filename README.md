## AI vs Human Text Detector

An end-to-end **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that classifies input text as **AI-generated** or **Human-written** using Machine Learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment via a **Streamlit web application**.

---

## Project Overview

With the rise of generative AI tools, identifying whether text is written by humans or generated by AI has become increasingly important.  
This project builds a machine learning-based classifier that analyzes textual patterns and predicts the origin of the text with a confidence score.

---

## Features

- Text preprocessing using **NLTK**
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Classification using **Logistic Regression**
- Model confidence score using probability estimates
- Interactive **Streamlit Web App**
- End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → deployment)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - NLTK  
  - Joblib  
  - Streamlit  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression  
- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF

## How It Works

1. Input text is cleaned (lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization)
2. Cleaned text is transformed using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
3. Logistic Regression model predicts:
   - **AI Generated**
   - **Human Written**
4. Confidence score is calculated using prediction probabilities
5. Result is displayed in a Streamlit web interface

## How to Run the Project Locally

Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd plagiarism-detection

Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py

Step 4: Open in Browser
http://localhost:8501


## Model Performance

Accuracy: ~99%
Precision, Recall, F1-score: High and balanced
Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report

## Future Improvements

Use transformer-based models (BERT)
Support multi-language detection
Improve dataset diversity
Deploy as a cloud-based API
